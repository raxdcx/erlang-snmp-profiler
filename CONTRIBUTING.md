Hi! I don't expect anyone will ever read this, but if you're here,
then welcome! The barrier to entry for this project is super low
because it's just a small diagnostics and troubleshooting tool that
only a few people will ever use or see.

There are also a few Rackspace-isms in it that would need to be
changed to make it more generically useful. Again, that's because it's
just a small tool for a few people to use.

That being said, feel free to tinker. There are no tests. Run it to
see if it works. If you want to open a pull request, include some
evidence that your change works and doesn't break stuff.
